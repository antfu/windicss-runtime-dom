## Prevent FOUC

To prevent FOUC (flash of unstyled content), you can update the following line to your `<body>` tag.

```html
<body class="block" hidden>
```

## Configurations

```html
<script>
window.windicssRuntimeOptions = {
  // enabled preflight
  preflight: true,
  // scan the entire dom tree to infer the classnames on page loaded
  extractInitial: true,
  // generate mock classes for browser to do the auto-completeion 
  mockClasses: false,
  // the windi config you are used to put in `windi.config.js`
  config: {}
}
</script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/windicss-runtime-dom"></script>
```

Refer to [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts) for more details.

## Notes

This is an **Experimental** project what ships the Windi CSS compiler to the client-side. It utilizes [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) to watch the changes for the entire dom, and injects the style to the `<head>`. This might have a certain impact on the client-side performance, please consider using build tools instead of this if the production performance is something you need to consider. That said, it still works great and out-of-box for the scenarios that you want to focus more on content and styling without complex setups.

And for a faster/lighter solution, you may want to check out [twind/shim](https://twind.dev/handbook/the-shim.html).
